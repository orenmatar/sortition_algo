# sortition_algo
Algorithms for citizen assemblies sortition process

At the moment the only algorithm is the diversity optimizer
it takes constraints on the values of every category, and within those constraints finds the most diverse panel possible
diversity is defined by having the intersections of categories as equal as possible
i.e. number of black men close as possible to black women, white men and white women
and so on for every intersection between categories (even 3 or 4 way intersections: black, urban, educated, woman)
